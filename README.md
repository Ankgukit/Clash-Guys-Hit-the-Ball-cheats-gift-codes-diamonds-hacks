Clash Guys Hit the Ball cheats gift codes today 3900 diamonds Hacks - These short and burly Clash Guys constitute the most basic types of enemies in the game. They carry bone sticks or other tools that can harm you or your dinosaur friends up close. As the most basic type of enemy, they may not be as powerful, but their strength is limited by their quantity, as it is not uncommon to see a group of cave people clashing with you and your team. They can be quite sturdy, but they are definitely at a disadvantage in remote attacks. You can also defeat these basic cave dwellers by hitting them with your staff, although if you haven't upgraded your hero yet, you may receive more than one blow.
